# Blockchain-based-Decentralized-Voting-System
Built blockchain based voting Dapp which would be more secure, transparent, immutable and reliable than the current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting

## Why do we need it? 
Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such as DDoS attacks, polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, malware attacks, etc, and also require huge amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense of distrust among existing systems. 
Some of the disadvantages are:

Long Queues during elections.
Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.
Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.
Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.
Cost of expenditure on elections is high.

## Solution: 
Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable
You can vote anytime/anywhere (During Pandemics like COVID-19 where itâ€™s impossible to hold elections physically
Secure
Immutable
Faster
Transparent
